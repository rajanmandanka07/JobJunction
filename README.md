# Job Junction

Job Junction is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It serves as a platform to connect local workers (laborers) with customers who need services such as TV mounting, cleaning, plumbing, and more. Workers can register, offer their services, and get booked for jobs in their area. The system also provides a secure way for users to search for and book services.
